#Steps to install, setup and run app on local machine
Warning!!! Strongly recommend to start with [backend](https://github.com/sysstas/ccback) configuration.

To start clone this repo
    
        `git clone https://github.com/sysstas/ccfront.git` 
        
Locate newly created folder: 

      `cd ccfront`

Now you need to configure ccfront/src/environments/environments.ts

You can rename environments-example.ts to environments.ts and change all square 
brackets to appropriate content (most of it you can get from backend .env).

##Run
To run app type in terminal

    ng s
    
 ##Done
 
 Now you can try app.
